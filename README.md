# Citi Bikes Challenge
#### [Tableau link](https://public.tableau.com/views/CitiBikesChallengeFinal/CitiBikes?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Overview:
The objective of this task is to analyze data obtained from Citi Bikes and evaluate the feasibility of implementing a comparable service in Des Moines. The analysis is based on data gathered from Citi Bike usage in August 2019 and assesses usage patterns by user type, duration, and gender. Although the data is specific to New York City, the findings regarding usage time and gender may have applicability to other markets. The outcome of the analysis will be presented to stakeholders, who will determine whether the proposed venture is feasible in Des Moines.

## Results:
The overview demonstrates that there were over 2 million rides for the month of August.  About 77% of users are subscribers and the gender breakdown shows that about 48% of users are male while about 38% of users are female.  About 14% of users do not have a gender type on record.

Based on a comparison of peak hours, it is apparent that the most favored time for returning bikes is 6 pm, with over 220,000 users doing so. In contrast, the busiest morning hours are between 8 am and 9 am, with slightly fewer than 160,000 users returning their bikes during that time.

The heat map analysis of weekday trips by hour and gender indicates that males and females exhibit comparable riding behaviors. However, the heat map displays a higher concentration of male users, as evidenced by the darker colors used to represent them.

The analysis of starting and ending locations reveals that both are equally popular, suggesting that users often begin and end their trips at the same place. This could indicate that the locations are frequently used as a starting and ending point for commuting or leisure activities such as shopping, dining, and tourism. Alternatively, it could suggest that these heavily trafficked locations are situated near commercial, residential, or tourist hubs, making them ideal spots for users to start and end their journeys.

## Summary:
This dataset provides opportunities for creating additional visualizations that could yield valuable insights. For instance, a bar chart could be generated to show the busiest locations during peak times in August. Due to the large number of locations, it may be prudent to limit the analysis to the top 10-15 sites. Additionally, further segmentation of user types could be conducted by generating a pie chart depicting the subscriber and customer metrics by gender. This could provide useful information for marketing initiatives, such as determining if one gender prefers subscribing to the service or if gender types are equally represented among user types.

The analysis indicates that a business model similar to Citi Bikes may be a feasible proposition in areas that share similarities with New York City. However, it cannot be assumed that this would guarantee success in Des Moines, as no analysis has been conducted on that region. As illustrated by the starting and ending locations map, the success of Citi Bike can be attributed in part to NYC's compact infrastructure and high population density. Consequently, it would be prudent to evaluate whether Des Moines' infrastructure and population could support such a business before moving forward with the venture. If the city is too spread out, users may find the service inconvenient and may not utilize it. Moreover, if the resident and tourist population is insufficient, the market may become oversaturated too quickly, making it difficult to attract new customers. Therefore, conducting additional analysis before proceeding with the venture is advisable.
