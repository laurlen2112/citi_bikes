# Citi Bikes Challenge
#### [Tableau link](https://public.tableau.com/views/CitiBikesChallengeFinal/CitiBikes?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Overview:
The purpose of this challenge is to parse data from Citi Bikes to determine if a similar operation is feasible in Des Moines.  This analysis examines Citi Bike data from August 2019 and compares data by user type, usage time, and gender type.  Although the data is specific to NYC, metrics regarding gender and usage time may be analogous to other markets.  The final presentation will be viewed by various stakeholders that will determine if this is a viable business for Des Moines.

## Results:
The overview demonstrates that there were over 2 million rides for the month of August.  About 77% of users are subscribers and the gender breakdown shows that about 48% of users are male while about 38% of users are female.  About 14% of users do not have a gender type on record.

The peak hours comparison shows that the most popular drop off time is 6pm, more than 220,000 users drop off bikes at that time.  Peak morning hours are between 8am and 9am, slightly less than 160,000 users drop off bikes during that timeframe.

A comparison of heat maps showing weekday trips by hour and gender demonstrate that both male and females follow similar ride patterns.  The higher number of male users are noted by the darker colors of the heat map.

Finally, a comparison of the starting and ending locations indicates that the starting and ending locations have similar popularity.  One inference is  users are starting and ending at the same location.  Another inference is that heavily trafficked locations are close to work, shopping, dining, housing, or tourist attractions so users are picking up and dropping off bikes at locations that complement their activities.

## Summary:
Additional visualizations can be gleaned from this data.  For example, the August peak time information can be drilled down to create an additional bar chart showing which locations are busiest during peak times.  Given the numerous locations, it would be wise to limit this inquiry to the top 10 - 15 locations.  It is also possible to break down the user type further.  For example, another pie chart can show the subscriber and customer metrics by gender.  It may be illuminating to know if one gender favors subscribing to the service or if gender types are equally distributed among user types.  These additional inquires could be helpful for marketing initiatives.

Finally, while the analysis demonstrates that a business model similar to Citi Bikes could be a viable venture in setting that shares commonalities with NYC, it may not be sufficient to predict the success of this venture in Des Moines because no analysis has been conducted on Des Moines.  As demonstrated by the starting and ending locations map, one of the reasons Citi Bike is successful is due to NYC's compact infrastructure and high population density.  Therefore, prior to moving forward on this business venture it would be wise to determine if Des Moines' infrastructure and population would support this business.  If the city is too spread out, users may not utilize the business due to inconvenience.  Additionally, if the resident population and tourist population are low, the venture may saturate the market too quickly and not be able to attract new customers.  Therefore, prior to moving forward, additional analysis should be conducted.
